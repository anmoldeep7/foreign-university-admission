## Novelty
1) Applied feature engineering to drop unwanted features, handle missing values, handle categorical features, handle feature scaling, remove outliers, explore the Correlation between numerical features, find relation between features and labels. This led to reduced mean squared error of the algorithm without increasing the complexity of the model.

2) Hyperparameter Tuning was performed. Grid search technique was used to select the best model among linear regression, lasso, and decision tree and subsequently the hyperparameters for the final model build which was used in the website.

# Features
1. Various plots to get detailed information about different factors affecting admit chances.
2. Train and load your own custom models using various algorithms on the go.
3. Look at raw data. 
4. Clean and Simple UX and UI :)
